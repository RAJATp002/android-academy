# Create Basic Android UI

## Objective
Practice Creating Basic Android UI

In this project you will create a simple Android UI using both LinearLayout and RelativeLayout. And adding some TextView, ImageView, and EditText. Also make sure the screen has Toolbar and different height using elevation. Also create button with ripple effect is possible. Try to learn the minimum requeirements of applying every UI, because some of them only available on later Android version. ***Let's get started!***

</br>

### First: Design a UI on a piece of paper, or imitate an existing App.

</br>

### Second: Determine which layout should be used or which UI component is needed to build that UI.
Take a look which UI is under LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, then take a look at every component, is that a TextView, ImageView, FloatingActionButton, or EditText. 

</br>

### Third: Re-create everything in Android Studio's layout editor. Choose text editor.
To create the UI under XML Editor, here are a simple way to create them, [Common Android Views Cheat Sheet](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-content/PDFs/Common+Android+Views+Cheat+Sheet+(1).pdf)


</br>

### Fourth: Make sure every UI is included in the screen, then categorize everything into appropriate layout
Put them under LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, or maybe both. Arrange them to look good. To use LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, take a look at [here](http://www.journaldev.com/9495/android-layout-linearlayout-relativelayout-example-tutorial)

</br>

### Fifth: Add Ripple effect and/or Elevation effect.


</br>

### Sixth: Give your final touch
For example, give a theme and/or style. Also make the UI looks beauty by configuring [margin and padding](http://www.singhajit.com/android-padding-vs-margin/). Take a look at [here](https://material.google.com/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-baseline-grids) to use Google's spec.
